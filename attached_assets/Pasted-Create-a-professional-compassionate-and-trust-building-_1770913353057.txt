Create a professional, compassionate, and trust-building website for a company that provides complete end-to-end funeral and after-death services.

The platform should allow users to enter details such as location, religion, cultural background, number of attendees, budget, and specific ritual preferences. Based on this information, the company will handle the entire process including cremation or burial arrangements, priest/pandit booking, ritual planning, documentation support (death certificate assistance), transportation, venue arrangement, prayer ceremonies, and post-funeral rituals.

The website should have a calm, respectful, and comforting design using soft colors (white, beige, light blue, or pastel tones). The tone should be empathetic and reassuring.

Include the following pages and sections:

Homepage

Clear headline like: “Compassionate Funeral Services – We Handle Everything with Care”

Short emotional introduction

Call-to-action buttons: “Arrange Now” and “Get Immediate Assistance”
